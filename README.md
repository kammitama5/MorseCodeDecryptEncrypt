# MorseCodeDecryptEncrypt
A personal project using Python to encrypt and decrypt morse code by letter

- The goals are:
 - Learn a little morse code
 - Learn a bit about how interpreters work, transpiling, etc.
 - Strengthen my knowledge of python and a project.
 - May be rendered using Flask or something..we'll see.
 - This is tied into a long-term goal of building a compiler. I currently have a [repo](https://github.com/kammitama5/Compiler)
   set up for this in Python, but my longer-term goal is to build one that is in C++.
   
## Notes

- sequence points
- tokens
- lexemes
- lexers
- parsers
